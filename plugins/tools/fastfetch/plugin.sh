  # `run_selected_plugins` in `lib/plugin.sh` sources the script.
  # It doesn't seem to export a specific PLUGIN_DIR variable easily accessible inside the function 
  # without some trickery or assumption.
  # BUT, we know the path is `plugins/tools/fastfetch/config.jsonc` from the repo root.
  # install.sh sets ROOT_DIR.
